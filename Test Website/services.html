        Viruses can be a huge headache. Most people do not even realize that they have viruses on their computers. There are also other malicious software out there that you should be aware of.

        Have you thought of updating the computer that you are using? Is it running a little slow? Well you can fix that by upgrading the hardware!
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>
        Upgrade RAM
        </b>
        <br>
        Just by upgrading the RAM in a computer, you can improve the performance dramatically. If you are running Windows XP it is recommended that you have AT LEAST 1GB of memory installed. If you are running Windows 7, you should have AT LEAST 2GB's of memory, even though the minimum requirement is 1GB. The more RAM installed in your computer the better. When you are running a 32 bit operating system, you can have up to 4GB of RAM, when running a 64 bit system, you can have more than that.
